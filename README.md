# BookstoreManagementSystem
This Bookstore Management System is a Java-based project that utilizes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for its Graphical User Interface (GUI). This system allows users to browse the bookstore's inventory, add books to their cart, and securely make purchases. Customers can also create and manage their accounts, which includes features like updating their personal information and viewing their purchase history. The system's inventory management module is designed to help bookstore owners maintain an up-to-date record of their stock and make informed decisions based on real-time sales data.
